# Weather API

Jessica Barry
EC 500 - Building Software

## Goal

- Use the OpenWeatherMap API and a csv file to create an API that receives either an airport name or an airport code, and returns the weather for the city of that airport
- Use CB/CI during development

## Instructions

Insert API key in config.py file

run ```python weather_api.py ``` The local host will start running and the welcome page will show.

To search for an airport, add a code param or an airport param. For example,

```/api/v1?ident=FACE```

```/api/v1?name=Ceres Airport```
